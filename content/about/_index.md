I’m an assistant professor at the Computer Science Department (DCC) of the Federal University of Minas Gerais (UFMG) since September 2013. DCC is one of the three CS departments in the country ranked as a center of excellence by the Brazilian Government.

From January 2012 until September 2013 I was a post-doctoral researcher at the Department of Mathematics at the University of Pennsylvania under the supervision of Prof. Andre Scedrov, with funds from the Stanford Science of Cyber-security MURI. During my post-doc I had the pleasure of maintaining a close collaboration with Prof. Fred B. Schneider from the Computer Science Department of Cornell University.

I obtained my Ph.D. in Computer Science from LIX, École Polytechnique (France) in 2011 under the supervision of Prof. Catuscia Palamidessi, with funds from CNRS and DGA. My dissertation on Formal Approaches to Information Hiding was a finalist of the Prix de Thèse ParisTech 2011, granted by the Paris Institute of Technology (ParisTech).
