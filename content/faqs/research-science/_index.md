### Research

</br>

**Question:** *Mário, is there an easy introduction to the kind of research you do?*

**Answer:** If you speak Portuguese, you can watch a general presentation of my work on the foundations of security and privacy here  [[Part 1/2]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ki8YNZypjAc) [[Part 2/2]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FerSVZkPes).

This is not all that I do, though. Take a look at my [Google Scholar profile](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=9r8YfCgAAAAJ&hl=en) to see more.

</br>

**Question:** *I am interested in participating in one of your scientific projects, at either the undergraduate or the graduate level. What should I do to get more information about that?*

**Answer:** If you are interested in working on one of my scientific projects, please send [contact me](../../#contact) so we can set a time to discuss the matter.

### General questions about science

</br>

**Question:** *How does homeopathy work?*

**Answer:** It's just a placebo.

</br>

**Question:** *I’m a Scorpio and my partner is a Pisces. What does that mean for our relationship?*

**Answer:** Nothing. Astrology is pseudoscience.

</br>

**Question:** *Is climate change a hoax? Do vaccines cause autism? Is Earth flat?*

**Answer:** Well, those are three different questions. But the answer to them is “no”, “no”, and “no”.

</br>

**Question:** *How can you be so certain about such “controversial” subjects?*

**Answer:** All hypotheses above have been refuted over and over using the scientific method. And the [scientific method](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/scientific-method/) is the most powerful, reliable way of finding out the truth that humankind has ever developed. Indeed, there is broad consensus about all these matters you mentioned in your previous questions; the “controversy” comes mostly from outside the scientific community.

A very intriguing discussion the question of *“How can we make intelligent decisions about our increasingly technology-driven lives if we don’t understand the difference between the myths of pseudoscience and the testable hypotheses of science?”* is addresse in Carl Sagan's amazing book *The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark*, listed in my Section on [Books on the popularization of CS, Math, Logics, and Science](../../cool-science-stuff/#books-on-the-popularization-of-cs-math-logics-and-science).
