      - I am back at UFMG from a sabbatical year in 2023 as a visiting researcher/engineer to [Inria Saclay](https://www.inria.fr/en/inria-saclay-centre), France, to collaborate with the team of [Prof. Catuscia Palamidessi](http://www.lix.polytechnique.fr/~catuscia/).

      - Our research has been used to evaluate the privacy in the microdata of The Official Brazilian Educational Censuses and is being used by [INEP](https://www.gov.br/inep/) (the Official Brazilian Institute of Educational Studies and Research) to [review their data-publishing policies](https://www.gov.br/inep/pt-br/assuntos/noticias/institucional/nota-de-esclarecimento-divulgacao-dos-microdados). (A summary of our methodology and results has been [published in English](https://petsymposium.org/popets/2022/popets-2022-0114.php).) The project has been renewed for the year 2024.
